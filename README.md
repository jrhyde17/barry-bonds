Probabilistic analysis of scenario in https://youtu.be/JwMfT2cZGHg.

Summary

Barry Bonds' 2004 season resulted in the highest OBP in the history of Major League Baseball. The question to be answered here is, how much of that was due to his hitting ability, and how much was due to intimidation alone? The YouTube video linked above describes a simulation of the season as if Bonds never swung at the pitches he received, in order to find out just how well he'd do if his hitting ability were removed from the picture. That simulation uses a random number generator to produce additional pitches when the pitches he received in real life were not enough to determine a result here. The upside of this method is that it is realistic to how baseball works in real life, but the downside is that there is uncertainty that comes from using a random number generator, and it isn't possible to tell whether the expected value of the simulation's result was above, below, or equal to the result in the video.

I wanted to know what that expected value was, so I conducted a simulation that eliminated uncertainty altogether. To do this, I used a probabilistic algorithm, which gave a fractional expected value for the probability of Bonds getting on base at each plate appearance. This is unrealistic, since the number of on-base hits does not remain an integer, but it does eliminate the uncertainty of the random number generator. My script here carries out the calculation for the expected number of on-base hits, and consequently the expected on-base percentage, for how Bonds' 2004 season might have played out if he never swung his bat.
